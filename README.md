# local-weather-data
Build my first WP plugin for getting weather data from OpenWeatherMap. I'll try to display it using a shortcode.

I have no experience on WP plugins, so will try to follow WP documentation and the Boilerplate example.

The goal is configure API Key and other local data as WP admin, then generate a shortcode to embed into a page or post.

Finally, auto insert the shortcode in a desired place.
